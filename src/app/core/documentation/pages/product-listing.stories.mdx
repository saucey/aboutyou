# Product Listing Page

The Product listing page appears when a visitor clicks a Category link from the Navbar( or SideBar in the mobile).
Storefront includes professionally designed products grid, or you can overrided the product listing page partially/fully.

`Note: Product listing page has URL same as the Bapy Category's path property`

The products pages uses `@aboutyou/backbone` SDK to fetch Products, Filters for the shop configures in the `storefront.config.ts` file.
The Category tree allows the user to easily navigate up/down the shop Categories.

### Products Grid

The [ProductTiles](?path=/docs/components-producttile--default) are lazy loaded in CSS-grid. Displays 2 products per row on mobile and 3 products per row on bigger screens.

We load a predefined number of products per API call, and more products can be loaded in a paginated manner on demand by the user. The number of products loaded per page can be easily configured.

### Content Tiles

The data for the content tiles for a specific category page is loaded on page load.
We use [ContentPLPBundleTileComponent](?path=/docs/components-contenttiles-plp-bundletiles--single-bundle-tile) and [ContentPLPGridTileComponent](?path=/docs/components-contenttiles-plp-gridtile--single-tile) components to display them.
The Content tiles appear scattered in between the Product tiles with an optimally calculated algorithm (which you can of course override).

### Category Tree

We use our [Tree](?path=/docs/components-tree--default) component to display the Category tree on this page.

### Filters and Sorting

Filters section display the configured filters from the `backbone`.
Selecting any filter or sort option is will reload the products and also add the filetrs in the url. This way all the filetrs are kept even after a page reload.
